      "message": "I haven\u0027t had time to look at this carefully yet, but I think there may be some bigger API questions to think about here:\n\nFirst, P-256 is a curve, not a Diffie-Hellman primitive. It is used to implement ECDH, ECDSA, and all manner of algorithms. In contrast, X25519 is a Diffie-Hellman primitive. (X25519\u0027s curve is curve25519, which is equivalent to edwards25519, the curve that underlies Ed25519. But as curves, those can be used to make other primitives.)\n\nSo while it is, IMO, nicer that we have APIs for ECDH-P256 instead of P-256 (elliptic curves are things you build cryptography out of), calling the module `p256` is weird.\n\nSecond, it\u0027s weird that you all call the private key an `EphemeralSecret`. While ECDH is typically used with ephemeral keypairs, it isn\u0027t always. You can have long-lived ECDH keypairs. It\u0027s possible that we make an API specifically tailored for ephemeral keys only (I see `diffie_hellman` consumes the object), but in that case, why is there a `from_private_bytes` API? If you believe you can serialize and deserialize the object, it\u0027s clearly not ephemeral anymore.\n\nIt\u0027s also weird to take an opinionated stance that ECDH with P-256 is ephemeral, but not X25519? They\u0027re the same kind of construct ultimately.\n\nFinally, although we haven\u0027t solved this problem in even the C API (sort of... there\u0027s the EVP Diffie-Hellman stuff, but it\u0027s tedious) and don\u0027t necessary have to at this iteration, it is a bit weird for X25519 and ECDH with P-256 to be so different in API. Go recently added `crypto/ecdh` to their standard library, which is a pretty nice abstraction.\nhttps://pkg.go.dev/crypto/ecdh",

      "message": "We also don\u0027t necessarily have to set up a trait hierarchy just yet. That comment was based on an incorrect assumption that you all had already done a completely different X25519 API, and I was trying to understand why it was different.\n\nI suspect a trait hierarchy and wanting to believe in fixed-width inputs will be tricky. Not all DH primitives have the same sizes. Also P-256 pulls in some added questions around compressed vs. uncompressed coordinates since it wasn\u0027t standardized as consistently.\n\nThough I guess this API also doesn\u0027t really handle that correctly yet, as it doesn\u0027t even implement the standard X9.62 serialization.\n\n\u003e it sounds like the preference is to remove the \"ephemeral\" aspect from the naming.\n\nIt\u0027s more than just naming. The `diffie_hellman` method consumes the object. I see it does it in the `p256` crate too... this seems like someone trying to make the Rust type system enforce ephemerality. That is something one could do, but then we can\u0027t have `from_private_bytes`.\n\nBut since there are valid reasons to do non-ephemeral ECDH, we\u0027d presumbly need the other API later. And then we have to answer what we\u0027re actually getting out of having separate ephemeral-only and reusable APIs.\n\nWhat are you actually planning on doing with this API? The lack of the standard serialization format is pretty surprising. Have you all gathered your requirements there?\n\n\u003e I might have been overindexing on the p256 Rust crate that provides the equivalent functionality. That was the reason why this module is p256 and also why the private keys are called EphemeralSecret.\n\nI see. I mean, looking to other APIs makes sense, but I think we need to be able to articulate why we made the choices we did. This may be something we should discuss next week.\n\nI will note though, that that crate has `p256::ecdh` and `p256::ecdsa` for exactly the reason I was mentioning here. P-256 is a curve, not an ECDH primitive.",
