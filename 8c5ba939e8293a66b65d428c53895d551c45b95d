      "message": "if it helps you could just remove this API for now, since we didn\u0027t end up actually using it. \n\nThe goal was to save some performance because we run a lot of hmac operations using the same key and have to build a new hmac instance each time, so we were hoping to save some performance by re-using the hmac instance by resetting its state rather than build a new one. Instead of this, we should probably add a `verify_slice_reset` or `finalize_reset` : https://docs.rs/digest/0.10.7/digest/trait.Mac.html#tymethod.verify_slice_reset\nhttps://docs.rs/digest/0.10.7/digest/trait.Mac.html#tymethod.finalize_reset",

      "message": "Eh, I don\u0027t mind keeping it around for now. I see their API has `reset` too.\n\nWhat\u0027s the benefit of `finalize_reset`, etc., over just implementing `Clone` on these objects? That\u0027s more thread-safe anyway, since it means you don\u0027t have to mutate your template.\n\nBetter yet, have a separate key type, like ring does. That\u0027s slightly more efficient memory-wise too, though our C API doesn\u0027t currently admit that optimization. (It should.)\nhttps://briansmith.org/rustdoc/ring/hmac/",
