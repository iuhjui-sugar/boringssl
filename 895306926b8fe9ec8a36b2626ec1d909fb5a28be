      "message": "Kind of annoying that we now have three of these. Trouble is there\u0027s no good place to stick random C++ utilities common to bssl_shim, unit tests, and the bssl tool. (test_support has a GTest dependency.) Ah well.\n\nAt one point I wanted to get better support for temporary files (was trying to write by_dir.c tests), at which point I\u0027ll move this to a `crypto/test/file_util.h` or something.",
