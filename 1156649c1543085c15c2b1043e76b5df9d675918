      "message": "\u003e You sure you need this?\n\nUnclear. This really only came out of https://boringssl-review.googlesource.com/c/boringssl/+/61730/7/ssl/ssl_lib.cc and trying to figure out how to guard `SSL_get_rfd`. `SSL_set_rfd` is `OPENSSL_NO_SOCK` because, despite the name, it makes a socket BIO, not an fd BIO. But then it also calls `BIO_set_fd`. Also that might suggest `SSL_get_rfd` is the same, but that\u0027s weird because it only calls `BIO_get_fd`, which is fd not socket. So that\u0027s all a mess.\n\nReally this means copying OpenSSL\u0027s separate `OPENSSL_NO_POSIX_IO` and `OPENSSL_NO_SOCK` abstractions may have been a mistake, and perhaps we should have just had one for both. But, well, we made both of them so I figured it was easy enough to just make those unconditional and not have to think about it too hard.\n\nArguably an embedded application could also make their own custom `BIO_TYPE_DESCRIPTOR` BIO, but I doubt it. :-)\n\nBut do we need this? Probably not. It just seemed the most self-consistent, even though it\u0027s accounting for cases that will never happen.\n\n\u003e I mean I guess windows is techincally that?\n\nNah, Windows has fds. They\u0027re a fake userland construct, but good enough for us.",
