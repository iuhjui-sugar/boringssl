      "message": "One thing that\u0027s kind of a headache: we have no GN builds that care about the BCM / libcrypto split, yet moving to this generic system means that Chromium\u0027s BUILD.gn needs to deal with it. It\u0027s not toooo bad, just means we keep having to write `bcm_sources + crypto_sources`, but ah well.",

      "message": "Oh hmm, as I upload this, I realize there\u0027s another headache I haven\u0027t resolved in my local test... that these are headers yet we name them `.c` is a real mess. I\u0027ve worked around it in the Bazel build, but the way I\u0027m toying with doing the GN build, this doesn\u0027t actually work.\n\nI\u0027ll have to give that a ponder. Honestly I\u0027m kinda tempted to just rename them all to `.h`. I could also bodge the Chromium build to exclude `bcm.c` and build each file individually, but that\u0027ll be a different sort of headache.",
