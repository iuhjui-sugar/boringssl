      "message": "(We don\u0027t have to worry about this now. I\u0027m just asking this to understand how Rust APIs evolve and what the patterns are.)\n\nFormally, AES-GCM is specified with a variable-length nonce, not a 12-byte nonce. This was bad and a mistake by NIST. Our `EVP_aead_aes_128_gcm` accepts all of them. This was probably also a mistake (https://crbug.com/boringssl/34) and we should have locked the default to 12 bytes. But alas there are protocols that use a non-standard nonce length, so if we did that, we\u0027d need `EVP_aead_aes_128_gcm_non_standard_nonce`. :-( \n\nIf this were to come up in Rust, how would we go about doing this? Do we abandon the `Aead` trait at that point? Abandon compile-time nonce sizing and just use `nonce: \u0026[u8]`?",

      "message": "Should we call this `decrypt_in_place` or something like that? This API is also slightly subtle... I take it the caller needs to know to remove `TAG_SIZE` bytes from the end. That should at least be documented, but it\u0027s probably also a bit unfriendly.\n\nLooking at the RustCrypto APIs, they have `encrypt` and `decrypt` that are similar to `encrypt` above. They take in a slice and return a `Vec`. That\u0027s probably the right model for the basic use case.\n\nThen there\u0027s `encrypt_in_place_detached` and `decrypt_in_place_detached` which returns the tag separately (encrypt) or expects you to pass in the tag separately. Those roughly correspond to our seal_scatter and open_gather APIs. (Except seal_scatter has this weird \"extra_in\" parameter which you probably should ignore... I think we need to bite the bullet and do iovec APIs at the C level...)\n\nThen there\u0027s `encrypt_in_place` and `decrypt_in_place` that uses this complicated `Buffer` machinery... I guess let you do dynamic dispatch to customize the extending/shrinking behavior. Mimicking that right now is probably unreasonable. 😊\n\nI think we will inevitably need some kind of in-place story, but we also don\u0027t have to solve that now if you don\u0027t particularly need it. My inclination is to do the first API, and then maaaybe the \"in-place detached\" API if we feel like it. (Possibly with the same name, possibly different.) It makes the in-place one a little fiddly, but moves the shrinking somewhere obvious in the public API, so it\u0027s not something the caller will forget to do.\n\nWDYT?",
