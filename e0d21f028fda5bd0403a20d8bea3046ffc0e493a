      "message": "Ok, So at least for the moment you don\u0027t have a constant time memory comparison operation.  What I\u0027m not 100% sure about is from a rustyness perspective what\u0027s better for us here.  Yes indeed, we can bind BoringSSL\u0027s comparison operations directly here, and I\u0027m more or less fine with this, but before we do that, Are we certain we don\u0027t want to say \"no we should use something that is more normal is rust code like subtle (https://docs.rs/subtle/2.5.0/subtle/)\" - especially if we\nbelieve we are doing to be pulling in stuff that already has such dependencies? \n\n@danakaj - penny for your thoughts there please?",

      "message": "The other consideration is requirements around \"constant-time\". (Poorly named. It should have been called data-independent execution.) Cryptography is in this awkward position where we both need constant-time for security, but we have no sound mechanism in the compiler to get there. Instead, we have to play chicken with the compiler. The higher level the language, the more risk we incur. (One could argue we should write all constant-time code in assembly, but that\u0027s obviously impractical.)\n\nKeeping the constant-time code in BoringSSL lets us concentrate that investment in one place. We\u0027ve got valgrind-based tooling to help us catch when the compiler gets too smart, and this `value_barrier` hack we sprinkle in when it becomes a problem.\n\nThis is all unsound and the real answer is to put this in the language, but that won\u0027t happen without *significant* compiler investment. :-( (We\u0027d need every optimization pass in LLVM to be re-examined to limit what the transforms allowed on \"secret\" types.)",
