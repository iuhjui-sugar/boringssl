      "message": "Weird that this is only showing up now.\n\nTrusty uses musl these days, right? (b/110161494) Perhaps, rather than having to guard every use of FILE BIOs, we should just make FILE BIOs work? In particular, it\u0027s weird that we simultaneously believe:\n\n* Trusty has FILE from stdio.h\n* Trusty has BIOs in general\n* crypto/bio/file.c only uses functions defined in C, not POSIX (I believe this is true)\n* Trusty somehow doesn\u0027t get to build crypto/bio/file.c\n\nIf you instead just remove the OPENSSL_TRUSTY guard in that file, how far is it from building?",

      "message": "This is actually showing up now because we\u0027ve hijacked Trusty for our firmware build of `boringssl`: http://b/273639386. We don\u0027t have filesystem support enabled in our firmware C library (newlib).\n\nWhat\u0027s interesting is that this *was* compiling fine, but when I tried to add a [change for unrelated compilation flags](https://crrev.com/c/4610318), the build started to fail. I didn\u0027t look into the exact reason the compilation started to fail, since it does look like it\u0027s wrong as written.",

(Embedded targets vary too much to be a single one, and we already have far too much tech debt to clean up from other embedded targets hacking around with the build.)\n\nIf you want to add support for a new embedded target, send the team list an email with details, and we can figure out:\na) Whether we can support you at all\nb) How best to handle that in code\n\nSupposing you pass (a), probably (b) will look like us recogizing your platform\u0027s #define and then generalizing the OPENSSL_TRUSTY ifdefs accordingly. Actually I\u0027m overdue for generalizing some of them for another embedded target anyway, so I may just go upload that...",

      "message": "Yeah, I suspect Trusty is getting by because the static linker is dropping BN_print_fp. :-) Agreed that\u0027s not great and we should do something.\n\nBut probably the right fix for Trusty is https://boringssl-review.googlesource.com/c/boringssl/+/60889, because they have a perfectly functional \u003cstdio.h\u003e these days. (A way that borrowing others\u0027 defines is awkward.)\n\nAlso uploaded https://boringssl-review.googlesource.com/c/boringssl/+/60890 which starts generalizing a few things. Though it leaves the FILE question alone... that one\u0027s a little fun because we have to decide on a boundary for \u003cstdio.h\u003e (elsewhere we assume `FILE*` and `stderr` exist).",
