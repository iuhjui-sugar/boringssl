(b/110161494) Perhaps, rather than having to guard every use of FILE BIOs, we should just make FILE BIOs work? In particular, it\u0027s weird that we simultaneously believe:\n\n* Trusty has FILE from stdio.h\n* Trusty has BIOs in general\n* crypto/bio/file.c only uses functions defined in C, not POSIX (I believe this is true)\n* Trusty somehow doesn\u0027t get to build crypto/bio/file.c\n\nIf you instead just remove the OPENSSL_TRUSTY guard in that file, how far is it from building?",
