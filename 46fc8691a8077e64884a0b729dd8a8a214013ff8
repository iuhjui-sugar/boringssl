      "message": "Hmm. That does mean we can\u0027t as easily squirrel it behind `OPENSSL_ia32cap_has_bit` and `OPENSSL_get_armcap` functions, but we can always just stick the line in every function, so that\u0027s not that strong of an argument against it.\n\nSince `CRYPTO_library_init` *only* initializes the CPU vector, I think adding extra calls can only help for assembly. I believe this is the list of asm functions that care:\nhttps://paste.googleplex.com/5556261343985664\n\nIt would definitely help with the `aes_hw_*` case. I think the others would still need their own calls though.\n\nThis also precludes us from marking these functions as `const` and allow the compiler to delete duplicate calls. Although it is *slightly* unclear to what extent this is valid:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/6867696/gcc-attributes-for-init-on-first-use-functions\n\nNot that this CL currently achieves it. Looks like we actually need to make an out-of-line function that combines CRYPTO_library_init and reading the value:\nhttps://godbolt.org/z/ohzrxY8e3\n\nI\u0027m slightly tempted to do that though. It\u0027s not uncommon for us to call these in series.

E.g. `EVP_get_cipherbynid` doesn\u0027t cover folks calling `EVP_aes_128_cbc` directly, which is our preferred API anyway. `EVP_get_cipherbynid` is hard to grep for and breaks dead code elimination.\n\nAnd then there\u0027s folks calling into `AES_set_encrypt_key` and friends directly. We could do it this way, but I figure a strategy like this is easier to be sure we\u0027ve gotten it all. (It also helps that, unlike upstream, our init function truly is just CPU capabilities. We don\u0027t need to add algorithms to a giant in-memory table or anything.)",
