      "message": "We mostly think of the CMake build as the developer build and that consumers use the generated file lists. As such, we always want -Werror on so that a) we catch stuff and b) we can address the new warnings that our consumers will hit. This change is moving the CMake build (further) away from being a developer build and I\u0027m not sure how we feel about that.",

      "message": "There are folks who want to build with CMake who aren\u0027t us, but yeah we\u0027ve never done a great job supporting them. -Werror or no, this build isn\u0027t great for them because it still requires both Perl and Go. We did a half-hearted attempt at a \"consumer\" CMake build in the generated list, but I\u0027m not sure it was really used much.\n\nWe have been talking about reworking the branch / generated file structure, so maybe the thing to do is park this until we\u0027ve done that? If we end up with a separate \"main\" and \"dev\" branches, that\u0027ll be a natural way to set that mode automatically, along with the eventual \"use pre-generated files\" vs \"take build deps\" mode.",
